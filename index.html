                    <p>On my first full day in Kenya I drove with friends one and a half hours 
                        northwest to Hell's Gate National Park. Hell's Gate is located in the lower
                        end of the Great Rift Valley near Lake Naivasha. This is a protected area
                        where wild zebra, giraffe, and other animals roam free. Near the entrance 
                        is a large rock tower where, with the help of a guide, the brave can
                        test out their rock climbing skills. My travel companions for the day talked me
                        into giving it a try, so I did!</p>

                <h2>Hiking in the Great Rift Valley</h2>
            `   <img src="C:\Users\Janary Stanton\Pictures\GRV Gorge Hike.jpg" alt="Hiking through the Gorge. Great Rift Valley" width="400" height="500"> <img src="C:\Users\Janary Stanton\Pictures\GRV climbing in gorge.jpg" alt="Climbing in the gorge" width="400" height="500"> <img src="C:\Users\Janary Stanton\Pictures\GRV mini waterfall.jpg" alt="Small Hot Spring Waterfall" width="400" height="500">
                    <p>After rock climbing we drove three miles into the valley to land historically and currently inhabitted by the Maasai tribe. There we went on to hike in the gorge 
                        led by our guide, Sam. I'm not an experience hiker, but I was up for the challenge, and a challenge it was! There were steep, rocky walls and passages so narrow 
                        we were literally walking on the sides of the mountain. In some parts we had to use ropes and well-worn foot-made steps to make it through the gorge.
                        It was an arduous trek to say the least.</p>

                <h2>Safari in Nairobi National Park</h2>
                <img src="C:\Users\Janary Stanton\Documents\Maasai welcome.jpg" alt="Maasai welcome" width="400" height="500"> <img src="C:\Users\Janary Stanton\Pictures\NNP giraffe.jpg" alt="giraffe" width="400" height="500"> <img src="C:\Users\Janary Stanton\Documents\NNP Injured zebra.jpg" alt="injured zebra" width="400" height="500">
                    <p>A couple of days later I went on my very first safari in Nairobi National Park. Nairobi National Park is the first national park in Kenya and it 
                        is the only national park in the world located within a city. At the entrance of the park we were welcomed by Maasai dancers who invited me to join
                        their traditional dance. Once inside you'd never know you were within city limits. The park is a spacious savanna. Without visible gates and fencing
                        we were able to experience the wild animals up close and personal. We set out on our tour in mid-morning so all of the predatory animals (namely lions)
                        were sleeping in the shade and all of their potential prey were out feeding. We saw giraffes, zebras, Thompson gazelles, and water buffalo. Seeing these
                        animals in the wild was like seeing them for the first time. They were so strong, graceful, and majestic.</p>

                <h2>The Bomas of Kenya Cultural Center</h2>

                    <p>Towards the end of my trip I went to the Bomas of Kenya Cultural Center. The Bomas of Kenya was established by the Kenyan government in 1971 to preserve, 
                        maintain, and promote the diverse traditional cultures of the variousl ethnic groups of Kenya. We arrived just in time to see the company's troup of 
                        professional dancers and musicians perform various songs and dances from enthic groups such as the Kikuyu, Luo, Luhya, and Samburu. Next we toured the 23
                        replica compounds of each of the ethnic groups. It felt like I was teleported back in time 500 years! On the day I went there were several groups of young 
                        school children there on field trips. I was just as wide-eyed and curious as they were. To learn more about the Bomas of Kenya visit their website <a href="https://www.bomasofkenya.co.ke/">bomasofkenya.co.ke.</a></p>
